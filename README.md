## VidarDB: A Versatile Storage Engine that Adapts to Your Workloads

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vidardb/vidardb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vidardb/vidardb)

VidarDB is actively developed and maintained by VidarDB Team.
It is built on RocksDB and earlier work on LevelDB by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for VidarDB database system. For ease of use, we provide a [Docker image](docker-image/README.md) that has a PostgreSQL interface and SQL is supported. More documentations are coming soon. Feel free to report bugs or issues via Github.
